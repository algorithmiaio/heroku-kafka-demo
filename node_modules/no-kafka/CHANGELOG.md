## 3.0 [not released yet]

### Backward incompatible changes
- Producer partitioner is now implemented as a class and `Kafka.DefaultPartitioner` matches Java client implementation. Custom partitioners should inherit `Kafka.DefaultPartitioner`
- GroupConsumer assignment strategies are also now implemented as classes. Custom strategies should inherit from `Kafka.DefaultAssignmentStrategy`
- Using async compression now by default
- Producer retries delay is now progressive and configured with two values `delay: { min, max }`. See [README](README.md#producer-options) for more.
- Default producer ack timeout has been changed from 100ms to 30000ms to match Java defaults
